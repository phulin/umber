# tex-command Guidance

Read the repository-level `AGENTS.md` and `docs/tex_command_core.md` before
editing this crate.

## Crate Role

`tex-command` is the sole target owner of canonical source tokenization, input
levels, raw command delivery, expansion, macro calls, conditions, scanners,
alignment delivery, and static profile dispatch. It depends on `tex-state` and
must never depend on `tex-exec`; `tex-exec` consumes its completed
unexpandable commands.

Host capabilities are borrow-scoped through `CommandHostContext` and must
never enter snapshots, formats, durable summaries, or owned command state.
Private state-machine modules must not be widened for compatibility with
`tex-lex` or `tex-expand`.

Line acquisition is **not** a host capability. tex.web §31's `input_ln` is
`tex_state::CommandContext::input_ln`, alongside `\ifeof`'s §501
`read_stream_at_eof`, because a terminal line and a `\read` stream are
`Universe` state rather than a host acquisition keyed by request, and because
`tests/it/boundaries.rs` forbids `CommandHostContext` from every file on the
line path. It is the one line source for both of tex.web's callers -- §363's
`firm_up_the_line` and §483-§486's `\read` -- and §71's `prompt_input(#)`
prints its own prompt inside the acquisition, so the command core has no
print channel of its own outside the borrowed
`tex_state::CommandContext::begin_diagnostic` diagnostic channel
`\tracingifs` uses (see `src/conditionals.rs`).

## File Map

- `Cargo.toml`: dependency-light crate manifest and boundary-test support.
- `src/lib.rs`: intentionally small public facade and private module tree.
- `src/host.rs`: borrow-scoped, nonserializable host-capability boundary.
- `src/profile.rs` and `src/profile/tests.rs`: public semantic character values,
  immutable engine/character profiles, capabilities, stable fingerprints, and
  focused value/identity tests.
- `src/state.rs`: persistent command state and discardable runtime ownership.
  Also owns `\tracingnesting`'s `record_source_open_depths`/
  `source_open_depths`, the `grp_stack`/`if_stack` recording e-TeX 2.6
  [23.328] compares at a source level's `end_file_reading`.
- `src/command.rs`: public opaque, ephemeral current-command representation.
- `src/error.rs`: private command error and resource-need representation.
- `src/fuel.rs`: checked finite command-work limits, the constructor-free
  borrow-only `CommandFuel` capability used by leaf operations, and the
  top-level `CommandFuelLedger` session owner shared by every canonical
  processor episode.
- `src/fatal.rs` and `src/fatal/tests.rs`: TeX82 §93 `fatal_error`,
  §94 `overflow`, and §95 `confusion` as one shared irrecoverable-error
  value, its canonical observation record, and focused label tests. Every
  present and future `succumb` site raises this type; §81 `jump_out` is
  modelled by the executor latching it as the session's terminal state.
- `src/input/source.rs`, `src/input/source/tests.rs`: public host-neutral
  source-registration inputs and errors plus private immutable backing,
  source cursors, and focused registration tests. It also owns
  `SourceNameClass`, TeX82 §303's partition of a source level's `name` into
  the terminal (`name=0`), input stream `name-1` (`1..=17`), and a text file
  (`name>17`). That is a third, independent classification: `InputReason` is
  a strict model of §307's `token_type` codes, which a source level does not
  have at all, and `RegisteredSourceKind` names how Umber acquired the bytes
  rather than which channel TeX reads them as. An open with no explicit class
  is §537 `start_input`'s file, because §537 is how TeX reaches every `\input`
  and the job's root file alike; only §331's terminal and §483's `\read`
  streams need `open_registered_source_as` (`umber2-johp.245`). It also owns
  `SourceRegistration::with_name` (§537's `a_make_name_string`) and
  `FileFramingEvent`, the queued `Open`/`Close` record of when a `File` level
  opened or exhausted. The queue exists because the input stack is reached
  from places that hold no `Universe`; `CommandState::render_file_framing_events`
  prints it as tex.web's `(name`/`)` bracketing through
  `tex_state::file_framing`, and the processor drains it the instant a source
  retires, because §362 prints its `)` ahead of the `check_outer_validity`
  diagnostic on the next line. Whatever the core could not render itself the
  engine drains once per step.
- `src/input/lines.rs`, `src/input/lines/tests.rs`: exact physical-line
  splitting, TeX line normalization, byte/scalar cursor and range accounting,
  and focused line-contract tests.
- `src/input/tokenizer.rs`, `src/input/tokenizer/tests.rs`: canonical
  token-at-a-time exact-byte and separately identified UnicodeExtended M/N/S
  tokenization, semantic control-sequence spelling, profile-specific
  superscript notation, invalid-character recovery steps, byte/scalar ranges,
  and focused conformance tests.
- `src/input/levels.rs`, `src/input/levels/tests.rs`: dense source/token-list
  levels, stored/transient/argument payload ownership, orthogonal delivery and
  retirement behavior, replay explanations, and focused ownership tests. A
  source level's `open_depths` field is `\tracingnesting`'s own record; see
  `src/tracing_nesting.rs`.
- `src/input/stack.rs`, `src/input/stack/tests.rs`: exact input retirement,
  retained v-template lifecycle, macro-activation cleanup, `param_start`
  parameter replay ownership, and trace-independence tests.
- `src/input/`: remaining private backup and summary state machines.
- `src/processor/`: public borrow-only processor facade with private raw
  delivery, expansion, scanner-status, and alignment orchestration.
- `src/processor/alignment.rs`, `src/processor/alignment/tests.rs`: canonical
  alignment-delivery state and focused stack, brace-depth, template, and omit
  lifecycle tests.
- `src/processor/expand.rs`, `src/processor/expand/tests.rs`, and
  `src/processor/fixtures/`: ordinary expanded-command delivery, expandable
  primitives, converted-token construction, focused private unit tests, and
  bounded source microfixtures.
- `src/scanners/`: private typed scanner family. `hyphenation.rs` owns TeX82
  §934/§960's `\hyphenation`/`\patterns` scans, which are `get_x_token`
  classification loops rather than `scan_toks` collections and so must never
  enter the `absorbing` scanner status or track a brace depth.
  `expression.rs` and `expression/tests.rs` own e-TeX 2.6's four typed
  expression scanners and two glue-level conversions, including their
  explicit parenthesis stack, arithmetic recovery, glue-order rules,
  observations, and checkpoint-retry tests.
  `structured.rs`'s `scan_accent_base` is deliberately a one-command step
  rather than a loop: TeX82 §1123 runs §1270's `do_assignments` between the
  accent code and §1124's base character, and executing an assignment is the
  executor's, not the scanner's. It replays only §1124's own `else
  back_input`, inside the delivery episode that fetched the command; a
  prefixed command is handed back still delivered, because §1270 executes it
  in place and a backup level here would deliver it twice.
  `scalar.rs` owns `back_input_unless_spacer`, TeX82's
  `if cur_cmd<>spacer then back_input`. §443's `⟨Scan an optional space⟩`,
  §444's `⟨Scan a numeric constant⟩`, and §452's `⟨Scan decimal fraction⟩`
  all end a numeric scan with that one rule, so every numeric scan routes its
  terminator through it rather than choosing per call site whether to absorb
  a space. The test is on the command, so it is the category code and never
  the character: §207 makes `spacer` the command a category-10 character
  carries, and §349 is what normalizes such a character's `cur_chr` to a
  space inside §341's `get_next`.
  `filename/tests.rs` owns focused expanded filename scanning, termination,
  replay, and registered-source retry tests.
  `structured.rs`'s `scan_math_field_episode` is TeX82 §1151's `scan_math`,
  a classification and not an absorption: every scalar case ends holding one
  math code, so the field pushes no input level, backs up no token, and never
  redelivers the command that selected it, and `othercases` is the whole
  remaining vocabulary reaching §1153's `back_input; scan_left_brace`. A
  frozen-spelling replay level here delivers each field twice
  (`umber2-johp.265`).
  `restricted.rs` owns TeX82 §433-§437's five restricted integer classes as a
  single mechanism: every bounded scan in the crate selects a
  `RestrictedIntegerClass` instead of open-coding a range test, and the
  recover-to-zero belongs to the scan, never to the command consuming it.
- `src/primitives/`: private static TeX82, e-TeX, and pdfTeX dispatch families.
  `registry.rs` owns the TeX82, e-TeX 2.6, and pdfTeX 1.40.27 expandable
  primitive identity tables and the fresh-INITEX versus format-restore
  installation policy. The retired `tex-expand` entry points are
  compatibility forwards to this canonical owner, not independent tables.
  `prefixed.rs` owns TeX82 §209's `max_non_prefixed_command` partition -- the
  single test §1211's `prefixed_command`, §1270's `do_assignments`, and the
  `\global` prefix all make. It is narrower than "this command assigns
  something": `\begingroup`, `\endgroup`, `\aftergroup`, `\afterassignment`,
  `\openin`/`\closein`, and every `extension` primitive are excluded, so a
  caller that starts from a broader notion and subtracts them by hand is
  re-deriving this predicate one exception at a time.
- `src/macro_call.rs`, `src/macro_call/tests.rs`: private canonical scalar
  macro matcher, invocation/argument activation ownership, and focused tests.
- `src/conditionals.rs`: private independent condition-stack machine; also
  renders e-TeX 2.6's `\tracingifs` `{...}` trace lines at conditional entry
  and at each `\or`/`\else`/`\fi` delimiter resolution, printed directly
  through `tex_state::CommandContext::begin_diagnostic` because tex.web's
  `show_cur_cmd_chr` fires from inside `conditional`/`pass_text` itself
  rather than through the executor.
- `src/tracing_nesting.rs`: renders e-TeX 2.6's `\tracingnesting`
  `file_warning` -- "Warning: end of file when ... is incomplete" for every
  group and conditional still open at a source level's natural EOF, compared
  against the depth `state.rs`'s `record_source_open_depths` recorded when
  that level opened. Called from `processor/next.rs`'s `retire_and_restart`,
  the one choke point every input-level retirement passes through. Prints
  through the ambient selector (`CommandContext::printer`), not
  `begin_diagnostic`'s `\tracingonline` redirect: unlike
  `\tracingassigns`/`\tracinggroups`/`\tracingifs`, `file_warning` is not
  `stat`-gated in `etex.ch`. `group_warning`/`if_warning` (a group or
  conditional closing inside a different file than it opened in, reported at
  that close rather than at file end) are not implemented; see
  `umber2-aqx9`.
- `src/scan_toks.rs`, `src/scan_toks/tests.rs`: private canonical token-list
  scanner and focused parameter, collection, expansion, scanner-status, and
  recovery tests. It also owns TeX82 §482's `read_toks`, which is deliberately
  _not_ a `scan_toks` mode: it collects whole lines rather than a
  brace-balanced group, holds `align_state` at `1000000` for its whole
  duration, and continues across a brace imbalance instead of ending at a
  closing brace. §486 does not balance a runaway `\read` by inventing
  braces; its whole recovery is `align_state:=1000000; limit:=0` plus the
  error, so the stored list keeps exactly the tokens the file supplied.
- `src/provenance.rs`: private command provenance construction.
- `src/observation/`: private aggregate read observation. `mod.rs` owns the
  record union and the exhaustive `Meaning`-level command classification;
  `primitive_identity.rs` and `variable_identity.rs` own the exhaustive
  primitive and eqtb-addressed variable identities beneath it. None of the
  three may reintroduce a catch-all: an unclassified meaning must be a build
  failure, never a plausible generic identity in a trace.
  `variable_identity.rs` also owns `parameter_mutation_key`, the single
  supported way to name a mutated named parameter. Umber's dense parameter
  bank slots are not tex.web's parameter codes, so an observation that
  formats a raw `IntParam`/`DimenParam`/`GlueParam`/`TokParam` slot reports
  one parameter's assignment under another's name (umber2-johp.134).
  `canonical_names.rs` generalizes that rule to the whole vocabulary: it is
  the only place any observation name is spelled, and it is re-exported as
  `tex_command::canonical_names` so producers in other crates and the
  differential tracer share one table rather than each keeping their own.
  See "Canonical observation vocabulary" below.
  Command identity is selected through the immutable `CommandProfile`:
  `variable_identity.rs` owns the TeX82/e-TeX 2.6/pdfTeX 1.40.27 eqtb and
  `last_item` layouts, while `primitive_identity.rs` owns profile-dependent
  conversion selectors. Never classify an observed command through a
  profile-free dialect approximation.
- `src/snapshot.rs` and `src/snapshot/tests.rs`: command snapshot, quiescent
  summary ownership, and focused internal roundtrip/rejection tests.
- `tests/`: external dependency, visibility, and capability-boundary tests.
  Character/input integration coverage binds the exact shared-domain tokenizer
  to the pinned TeX82 fixture and compile-fail gates profile immutability.

## Canonical Observation Vocabulary

Every string an observation payload carries for a _concept_ -- a category
code, a character command, a scanner status, a glue order, a token's catcode
or spelling, a meaning's command name -- is spelled once, in
`src/observation/canonical_names.rs`, and nowhere else. Producers in
`tex-command` and `tex-exec` and the differential tracer all call it.

Rules, all of them load-bearing (umber2-johp.141):

- **tex.web is the authority, never Umber's enum spellings.** §207 fixes the
  category codes and the command codes that share their numeric values; §135
  fixes the glue orders; §305 fixes `scanner_status`; §289/§365 fix how a
  token is represented. Umber's Rust variants are `Superscript`, `EndLine`,
  `Parameter`, `Ignored`, `Active`, `Invalid`; tex.web's names are `sup_mark`,
  `car_ret`, `mac_param`, `ignore`, `active_char`, `invalid_char`.
- **The catcode table and the character-command table are different tables.**
  They agree only at codes 1..8 and 10..12. Catcode 0 is `escape` but command
  0 is `relax`; catcode 9 is `ignore` but command 9 is `endv`; catcode 13 is
  `active_char` but command 13 is `par_end`; catcode 14 is `comment` but
  command 14 is `stop`; catcode 15 is `invalid_char` but command 15 is
  `delim_num`. Keeping one table and reusing it for both is a naming defect
  that will look correct on most inputs.
- **A Rust `Debug` rendering must never reach an observation payload,** and
  never round-trip through one either: `Debug` spells Umber's variant names
  and the oracle spells tex.web's, so any agreement is accidental. A
  `format!("{x:?}")` in a record field, or a transport that prefix-matches a
  record field against a Rust variant name, is a bug on its own terms
  regardless of whether a fixture currently notices.
- **Each family gets one total function with a single entry point.** No
  silent catch-all: an unnameable value either has an explicit,
  tex.web-cited arm or gets a deliberate name no engine installs
  (`undecodable_meaning`, `uncommandable_character`) so that it looks like the
  internal defect it is. Adding a `Catcode`, `Order`, or `ScannerStatus`
  variant must fail to compile until it is placed deliberately.
- **Never re-derive a name a producer already computed.** A transport that
  recomputes a command name from the spelling instead of carrying the
  producer's is a second, divergent table; it will silently mask engine
  divergences that the producer's name would have exposed, which is exactly
  what a spelling-derived command name did until umber2-johp.141 deleted it.
